"Are you guys busy eating all the corn and tomatoes before the end of summer? It’s hard to believe that it’s the last week of August. Where did the time go?! It’s almost even harder to believe that it’s pumpkin spice latte season. Does PSL season start earlier and early every year? And do people start talking about the end of summer absurdly early? I feel like almost all the posts on Instagram have been talking about the end of summer, but summer isn’t over yet. Technically it’s not over until September 23rd.,If you’re looking to hold on to summer a little longer (it’s still summer for a month guys!), this is the right recipe for you. It’s got soft and sweet oven roasted jammy tomatoes, crisp corn, and cauliflower gnocchi. I’m still doing keto – or, well, a version of it anyway and as I’m trying to introduce a couple more healthy carbs into my life, I’m finding that the Trader Joe’s cauliflower gnocchi is the way to go.,I’ve talked about TJ’s cauliflower gnocchi before: I love the crispy texture that they get when you pan crisp them straight from frozen. The insides get soft and chewy and oh so good. This recipe is mostly hands off: the tomatoes and corn get all happy in the oven while you hang by the stove and brown and flip those lil cauli nuggets. I have the bad habit of looking at my phone while I brown things – so if you do it too, I suggest setting a timer so you don’t let the gnocchi get too brown.,After everything in the oven is cooked, it’s just a question of slicing the corn off the cob, tossing everything together, and seasoning with salt and pepper. I added a poached egg on top because still I love eggs on everything. It was a tiny bit more medium than I wanted – I was hoping for a yellow flow of yolk-y lava – but it was really really good plus it added a bit of protein.,Tomatoes and corn forever!,

"It’s hatch chile season and as all the posters at the grocery store say, “hatch chile is here, it’s now or next year!” Mike and I are huge fans of hatch chile, especially after our little trip to New Mexico. We even stopped in the tiny town of Hatch, but since it wasn’t quite Hatch season, nothing was going on. We saw all the giant kitschy plastic sculptures and fields and fields of growing hatch plants, but there was no roasting and the one place that we wanted to have a green chile cheeseburger at was closed.,If anything, driving though hatch during off season made us even more excited for those spicy little green peppers. So excited that we accidentally on purpose bought a whole case. Yup, 25 pounds of fire roasted hatch. I was super duper excited but for some reason I was a little crazy and we bought a box of hot. And woah, are they hot. Mike said that he actually wanted to get the mild, which would have been much more reasonable, but when I said hot, he went along with it because he loves spicy things.,So now we have a bunch of super hot hatch chile in the fridge. I think I spent about 2 hours skinning and seeding all of them, with gloves on of course. But now that that’s all done, it’s time for the fun stuff. Stuff like creamy dreamy spicy hatch green chile mac and cheese.,This is essentially your classic mac and cheese with chopped fire roasted hatch green chiles stirred in for a bit of heat. You can get creative with the cheese – I went with a mix including pepper jack just so there was even more heat. Thick and creamy, spicy comfort food deliciousness. SO GOOD.,Happy hatch season!,
xoxo steph,PS – Do you guys have any hatch recipe ideas for me? Mike made some green chile with pork but we still have SO MUCH. Send me all the ideas!"
"Do you ever get hit by a random craving in the middle of the night? The other day it happened to me and it was doughnuts, of course. Delicious, hot, sweet and fluffy doughnuts. I could have left the house to find a random 24 hour doughnut shop, but at that point in the night, leaving the house seemed like a massive undertaking.,Instead, I decided to whip up a quick batch of doughnuts based on what was in the pantry. A quick Google search lead me to a fifteen minute doughnut recipe: perfection!,These doughnuts literally come together in fifteen minutes – most of my time was spent impatiently waiting for my oil to heat up. I also had a bit of a tussle with an overflowing drawer while looking for a brown bag for tossing the doughnuts in cinnamon sugar. You can, of course, just roll the doughnuts in a dish with cinnamon sugar, but I love shaking them up in a brown bag.,These doughnuts remind me of , you find at the fair. You know, the ones that pop out of that tiny doughnut making machine with the hot oil twisty slides. I love those doughnuts! I didn’t make it to the local fair this year, so it was nice to have a tasty reminder. Summer may be “over” but you can relive your summer fair memories with these fifteen minute doughnuts."
"Gosh darn it, I love French toast. The crisp caramelized exterior, the eggy soft custard bread-y insides. The toppings. The icing sugar. The syrup. EVERYTHING about French toast makes me insanely happy. I feel like maybe I could start a French toast restaurant? Like IHOP but for French toast? International House of French Toast? IHOFT? Would you hit it up? I would do sweet and savory French toasts and I would make sure if you wanted you could order a progression of French toasts so you could start with a little appetizer style one, then move on to a savory, then have a dessert one. We could do sizes too so you could just get one slice if you want to have more varieties. GAH. It would be SO GLORIOUS.,If I ever did have a French toast restaurant, you better believe that these churro French toast sticks with dark chocolate ganache dipping sauce would be on the menu. French toast sticks just taste better than regular French toast, am I right? I think it’s the sheer fact that you can dip pick them up with your fingers and dip them.,I came up with these churro French toast sticks because I had a major churro craving and did not want to whip up a bunch of choux and deep fry it. I was fiending for cinnamon and sugar and saw a old-ish loaf of bread and it all came together for me in one of those genius hungry at 10 in the evening moments: churro French toast sticks. Sticks because they are kinda of sort of churro shaped and French toast because when is French toast never a good idea?,These guys hit the spot, especially dipped into a decadent dark chocolate ganache. It kind of reminded me of churros in Spain! I love how they make churros there: in a giant vat of oil all curled up into a spiral of deep fried deliciousness. They don’t really do the cinnamon sugar thing, but they do have a thick chocolate dipping sauce. I guess I ended up with the best of both worlds because I did the Mexican cinnamon sugar churro with the Spanish chocolate dipping sauce. Seriously the best breakfast you could have, even if you eat it at night like I did.,PS – In case you too are a French toast fanatic, here are some other French toasts to check out: ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, and ,."
"The other day Mike and I and a couple of friends did a Hot Ones challenge. We supplied the wings and the air fryer, one friend brought ALL the hot sauces, and another one brought the booze. It was a hilarious night filled with hot sauce, tears, chicken wings, and pure love.,I fried all the wings in the air fryer as we went along the hot sauce progression and it was really awesome because a.) it was hands off b.) it was super consistent c.) it gave us time to recover in between hot sauces. The wings were so good that the next day, when we had a bunch of wings leftover, Mike and I decided to fry them up in the air fryer.,Naked air fryer wings are a ridiculously beautiful burnished brown. They’re incredibly crispy even without any coating or battering because chicken wing skin is, well, fatty, which crisps up perfectly. They don’t need much. In fact, I ate my wings naked with just salt and pepper (because I’m still doing keto) while Mike had his doused in a sweet, sour, salty Vietnamese fish sauce, kinda like a super easy cheaters Pok Pok wing. Fish sauce chicken wings are the bomb!,Air frying chicken wings is the easiest thing ever – what are you waiting for?!,PS – Should I do a whole post about the Hot Ones challenge? We didn’t take any great photos but I do have some great stories and an opinion on all the hot sauces we tried."
"I love udon noodles so much that ,. It did not disappoint. Nor did it do anything to ease my intense craving for udon noodles. Udon noodles are the best: thick and chewy, infinitely slurpable, and so so easy to cook and eat.,If you’re looking for a new weeknight staple, it should be udon. We always have a pack (or five) of frozen udon bricks in the freezer. Of course, you could use those instant udon packs, the pre-cooked ones that come shrink-wrapped, but if you want udon on another level, head to your local Asian grocery store, take a peek in the freezer and do yourself a favor and buy the frozen udon. They taste infinitely better than the shelf-stable cryovac udon.,Frozen udon is sold in bricks, with usually 5 bricks in a package. They’re super easy to prepare: just thaw and go. And best of all, most of the frozen udon that’s sold in North America is actually imported from Japan. We often see brands sold here that are the same as what we see the grocery stores in Tokyo. Frozen udon is the best: it’s practically instant and takes on all the flavors of whatever you’re cooking it with. We’ve done kimchi udon, spicy beef udon, bacon and egg udon, even cacio e pepe udon. Udon is the great blank noodle canvas, just waiting for your flavor creativity.,Speaking of flavors, this recipe is ideal for weeknight cooking: huge flavors, minimal chopping, and a quick cook time. We’re developing a huge hit of flavor from store bought curry paste, which if you’re buying the right brand (we like Aroy-D), has a pretty simple ingredient list: chili, garlic, lemongrass, shallots, salt, galangal, kafir, lime, coriander, and cumin. No weird preservatives or colors or names that you can’t pronounce. Curry paste is one of those things that lasts practically forever in the fridge and can be stirred into just about any sauce or soup for a bit of extra warmth and oomph.,Once you have all your ingredients assembled, everything goes really quickly. Thaw the udon in a bowl of hot tap water, mix all the sauce ingredients together, brown the pork, add the snap peas, then add the udon, sauce, and toss. Boom. It’ll take you longer to find something to watch on Netflix than it’ll take you to stir fry these noodles. Happy noodling!"
"Mike and I took a little road trip earlier this summer and I have to say, the highlight was New Mexico. It was our first time and now that I’ve been there, the state slogan really rings true. ,. Enchantment and green chile cheeseburgers. Green chile cheeseburgers, if you haven’t had the pleasure of trying them are amazing. Really, they’re regular cheeseburgers, but once you add the chopped fire roasted green chile on top, they’re something else.,If you’re eating burgers in New Mexico and you order a burger, you’ll get the question: do you want chile on that? By chile (chile with an “e” by the way, never chili, which is used to refer to chili con carne or chile with meat), they mean fire roasted and chopped green chiles. They have them year round but come late summer and fall, the hatch chiles start getting harvested and everything smells smoky and delicious from all of the fire roasting going on at all the grocery stores.,By the way, if they ask you if you want chile on it, the answer should always be yes. We were at a burger place and someone answered no and I swear I saw the server physically recoil as if it was absolutely the wrong answer. Anyway, if you can’t make it to New Mexico, it’s relatively simple to make a green chile cheeseburger at home. Pick up some long green peppers – hatch is preferable but of course anaheim works too. Lightly oil and roast them in the oven, then skin, seed, and chop them up. Go about your usual cheeseburger making and just before you put the cheese on to melt, add a generous amount of chopped chilies.,There’s a bit of a debate on wether the green chiles should be on top of the cheese or under a blanket of melted cheese. Both Mike and I agree that underneath melted cheese is better for eating because the cheese blanket holds everything together. That being said, for this post we went with the green chiles on top because we wanted everyone to be able to see the green chiles. It’s up to you what you prefer green chile wise. We’ve seen plenty of both in New Mexico, so go with your gut.,This is what we settled on for our ultimate double double hatch green chile cheeseburger, but of course there are no hard and fast rules in the green chile cheeseburger world. If you like a thick patty or maybe cheddar or pepper jack, go for it. Just make sure there’s a generous amount of green chile – its the heart of the burger."
"If you’re looking for an easy yet impressive home cooked meal for date night, the answer is – and forever will – be steak. There’s just something about making steak at home that is so incredibly impressive. I love it when Mike makes me steak and I know that he’s equally happy when I make it for him. It just seems extra luxe to be making steak at home. It probably has something to do with the fact that steakhouses tend to be high end fancy affairs. But the secret to steak is: you can make it at home just as good or even better for a fraction of the cost.,Once you’re done making your steak (,), all you need to take it over the top is the special sauce. These are our best steak sauce recipes: super easy steak sauces that have 6 ingredients or less and are easy to whip up while your steaks are reverse searing the oven. Never pay extra for sauce at a steakhouse again!,
If you’re looking for a classic steak sauce, you can’t go wrong with peppercorn. It’s a classic for a reason: a hint of complexity from the brandy, a hit of creaminess from heavy cream, and a huge amount of freshly crushed peppercorns for a light floral spiciness.,
If you love the spicy bite of mustard to cut through the richness of steak, this is the sauce for you. Fool around with different types of mustard – whole grain is particularly good, as well as dijon. The heavy cream adds a bit of body and thickness.,
What’s not to love about pan caramelized mushrooms with garlic, especially when you stir in a bunch of parmesan and little bit of cream. This is one of those sauces that you’ll want a lot of, so maybe do yourself a favor and double up. It tastes great on pretty much anything.,
If you haven’t had a coconut curry steak sauce before, please try it! It’s kind of reminiscent of that mysterious green steak sauce that they have at that famous French steak frites chain Le Relais de L’Entrecote. Theirs is more of a butter based green sauce, but I swear there’s a hint of curry in it? Maybe not, but this coconut curry sauce is amazing: warm and deep from the spices and shallot with a hit of umami from the fish sauce. Try it, you’ll love it!,
This is a delicious take on chimichurri that Mike came up with that I cannot get enough of. Classic chimichurri is parsley, garlic, olive oil, oregano and red wine vinegar. Mike switched it up for cilantro, garlic, toasted sesame oil, soy, and rice vinegar. Super savory and completely moreish. It’s probably the easiest of the steak sauces to make and the prettiest too because of all the green.,
If you’re looking for some delicious sides to eat with your steak, here are some suggestions:,

"Sometimes the most classic things are the hardest to make. Things like cookies. I mean, basically anyone can make passable cookies. But the real genius in making cookies is are they not just good, but are they great? Are the epitome of cookieness? Do they hold up the next day? Do they appeal to even the most discerning cookie palate? ,. I mean, I’ve been pretty much ,.,Snickerdoodles on the other hand, now that’s a tough cookie to crumble. If you’re a snickerdoodle lover like me, you’ve probably searched google for “The Best Snickerdoodle Recipe.” For a while, the top hit was Ms. Sigg’s Snickerdoodles. On the front page of google there are a bunch of other recipes claiming they’re the best too. I’ve made them all. And even though there are ,, there isn’t a classic straight up regular snickerdoodle. The reason why is that I’ve never felt like I’ve nailed them. But now, after much trial and error, I’ve come up with my ultimate snickerdoodle.,My ultimate snickerdoodle has ripple-y rings of different textures: crispy golden edges and a thick, soft and chewy middle. There’s a hint of toffee from the nuttiness of the brown butter and there’s plenty of cinnamon in the cinnamon sugar coating (but none in the dough). There’s a combination of brown sugar and white sugar so the cookies are both tall and moist (thanks to the brown) and crispy on the edges (thanks to the white). The cream of tartar adds just a bit of tang in the background and there should be just enough salt to accentuate the sweet.,Of course, that’s just what I like in a snickerdoodle. Like all classic things, snickerdoodles can be a nostalgic thing for people. Some people like them soft and thin, some people like them crispy. For me, thin snickerdoodles are a travesty but I definitely despise puffy snickerdoodles too. There’s a fine line and snickerdoodles, unlike the chocolate in chocolate chip cookies have nothing to hide behind. They’ve got to be just right.,For years I’ve been making Ms. Sigg’s snickerdoodles. It’s the cookie that Mike and I love making both for each other and for ourselves. But then, in an effort to make an even better cookie (I was inspired after my chocolate chip cookie success), I decided to do some experimentation. And here we are. Mike said that these browned butter snickerdoodles were AMAZING and I’m dubbing it my best brown butter soft and chewy cinnamon sugar snickerdoodle. ,I went with an adaptation from the ,. It has 41 five-star ratings so I figured it was a good place to start. I liked how there was both white and brown sugar in the dough – so many snickerdoodle recipes just have white sugar, which I find leads to a flatter, crispier cookie. To make sure I had a thicker cookie, I also upped the flour by 2 tablespoons, mimicking the butter to flour ratio I have in my best salted brown butter chocolate chip cookie recipe. I also changed the ratio of the cinnamon sugar just a touch and made much larger cookies,But the biggest difference was browning the butter. Browned butter is my jam. Ever since my first browned butter baked good (,) I’ve been hooked.,I hope you give these snickerdoodles a try. I know I’ll be making them over and over again!"
"Have you guys been to Greece? I’ve never been but I’ve always been interested in the azure blue seas, the white washed buildings, and the food. Oh, and the partying. I always think of partying when I think of Greece because when I was in high school I had a pen pal (do they still do that in high school? Pen pal cultural exchange things?) who told me that she would go out with her friends and party until four in the morning and then go out for chicken souvlaki. It sounded so grown up and mysterious to me. At 13 I definitely wasn’t a stay out all night kind of person. And, who am I really kidding, I’m not one now either.,The chicken souvlaki at four in the morning I could go for though. I’m all about crazy late night eats. It’s one of the only things that can entice me out of a cozy bed: snacks. Snacks or full on meals, I’m not picky. It would be so amazing to just roll out of bed to head out for a plate of chicken souvlaki, wouldn’t it?,Since my 4 am street side Greece chicken souvlaki dreams aren’t likely to come true, the next best thing is making souvlaki at home. And the best thing is, chicken souvlaki is dead easy to make. All you do is marinate some cut up chicken in oil, lemon, garlic, oregano, and salt and pepper. Everything gets all tasty and juicy then you thread it all on a skewer and grill it. Or if you don’t have a grill, broil it in the oven.,Serve everything up with a fresh and creamy tzatziki yogurt sauce and some slightly pickled cucumbers and you’ve got yourself a vacation on a plate. This chicken was seriously SO GOOD. And, it fit perfectly into my keto-friendly, low carb diet!,PS – Mike and I really need to make it to Greece. Just last week my mom posted an Instagram of her in Santorini. Talk about #goals right? Santorini is definitely on my must visit list LOL."
"If you’re looking for a quick and easy snack that still has a bit of luxury, look no further than burrata and kale. Burrata is everywhere these days and I’m still obsessed with its creamy, luscious, soft curds. It’s always burrata season!,The other day we had a ball of it in the fridge, just waiting for a special dish. But then I made a quick kale and tomato sauté and thought, hey, why not? We broke open the burrata on top and it was amazing because cheese and greens and tomatoes will forever have my heart."

"Have you ever seen mochi and asked yourself, “why is mochi so popular?” What even is mochi? I’m hear to answer ALL your mochi questions.,I LOVE Japanese mochi with a passion. The first time I ever ate it was at a yakitori shop. Mike and I saw another couple at beside us at the bar with these golden brown toasted crispy things on a skewer topped with seaweed and sesame seeds. I didn’t know what they were but they were cute and looked super yummy so we asked the server what they were and it turns out they were grilled mochi or yakimochi. They were amazing: savory and sticky and just the right play of texture between the crunchy outsides and the gooey chewy insides. I was hooked. From then on, I was all about mochi, all the time, every time.,If you haven’t had or heard of mochi before you must be wondering what I’m going on about. First off, mochi is a Japanese rice cake. It‘s made form pounded Japanese short grain rice and it comes in many, many shapes. It’s chewy and white and not at all sweet. The funny thing about mochi is that people often mistake it for a sweet thing.,You’ve probably seen mochi as a topping at frozen yogurt places: chubby little pieces that add a delightful chew. Or maybe you’ve spied it in the freezer aisle at Trader Joe’s as mochi ice cream – thin, snowy, soft, pliable blankets tucked around balls of frozen ice cream. Or maybe you’ve had crispy edged mochi cakes or those super cute Japanese mochi donuts. Thing is, those things aren’t technically mochi. Things like mochi ice cream, dango (,), and strawberry daifuku are made from rice flour. Sounds confusing but it’s not and really, you don’t need to know about the difference in mochi and dango/daifuku to enjoy it. When I like something, I go in deep, so I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about sticky rice things.,Anyway, I’m here to tell you that if you’ve only had “mochi” in a sweets capacity, you need to expand your horizons. Mochi is AMAZING when it’s savory. The genius of mochi is that it is a blank slate for flavors and in Japan, its incredibly popular as a savory item.,Mochi is a little hard to describe, but the number one thing you need to know about it is that it’s all about the texture. Japanese people often describe things as “mochi-mochi” and what they mean is, soft and chewy in the best way possible. Bread can be mochi mochi, cake, noodles, you name it, it can be mochi-mochi. It’s fun to say and even easier to eat. You can find it in ,, deep-fried as a snack, on ,, grilled up and drizzled with miso, in okonomiyaki, ,, and the list goes on.,Mochi is super easy to prepare at home and because it’s sold in shelf stable blocks (usually individually wrapped), it’s an awesome pantry item for a quick snack. You can find blocks of mochi, called kirimochi, at Japanese grocery stores or online.,The best and easiest way to prepare mochi is to grill, bake, or lightly fry it. Grilled mochi, called yakimochi in Japanese, is so popular that they sell little grill pans at the ¥100 store so that people can grill mochi in their houses, on the stove. We bought one a local Daiso and they work great. You can also just puff it up in a dry non-stick pan or on a wire rack in the oven. You’ll know it’s ready when the outside gets a little golden and toasted and the mochi puffs up.,Everyone likes their mochi a different doneness so I recommend trying out a few methods and times until you find your perfect mochi. I love it extra crispy, but some people like it lightly golden and very soft and chewy inside. However you’re like it, the beauty of kirimochi is that you can eat it anyway you want, kind of like bread. Think of mochi like bread: when it’s toasted, it becomes even greater than when it’s original state. And when you add toppings, it can become a whole meal.,One of the easiest and most classic ways to enjoy mochi is isobeyaki. After grilling, mochi is drizzled or dipped in a lightly sweetened soy sauce and wrapped with seaweed. It sounds kind of plain, but there’s something about the mix of crispy chewy mochi, sweet and savory soy sauce, and seaweed that tastes absolutely stellar. It’s one of my favorite ways of eating mochi. Sometimes I’ll even go a bit crazy and deep-fry mochi bits, then drizzle them with sweet soy sauce, the use seaweed to pick them up and eat them. Seriously so good.,And, if you’re looking for some other mochi topping ideas, you could always drizzle it with miso, ,, top it off with cheese, make little pizzas, use mapo tofu sauce. Honestly, the sky’s the limit!,If you made it to the bottom of this post, you’re a trooper! Please, please try mochi soon! Introduce it to all your friends. Microwave it lightly, cut it up, pop it on a skewer, and have grilled mochi at your next BBQ. It’s definitely a conversation piece, the way the skewers puff up and deflate, turning from a pure white to a delicious golden brown. If you have a bunch of toppings at the ready, it can be a DIY mochi grilling party."
"When you’re trying to eat healthier but want something more substantial than a leafy green salad, broccoli salad is there for you. I love the crunch and heft of broccoli, especially when it’s cut up into bite size spoonable pieces.,Some people aren’t into raw broccoli, but I love it! I always go for the raw broccoli on those vegetable platters that seem to be at every potluck/party you go to.,This is a simple broccoli salad: you have the bulk of it, raw broccoli; crunchy red onions for a bit of acidity and raw crunch, craisins for sweetness, almonds for a nutty counter point; and a sweet and tangy soy-rice vinegar-sesame dressing.,Make it for dinner and eat it with a spoon. So satisfying."

"Anyone else think that they could live on takeout? I definitely feel like I can because give me ALL the Chinese food. When I was a kid, my favorite food days were the days that my mom was too tired to cook. We’d order delivery and there would always always be some sort of chow mein dish. It’s funny because even though we are Chinese and my mom makes perfectly delicious chow mein, there’s something about delivery chow mein that is so much better.,I have to say though, there’s something so satisfying about making something yourself. Especially when it comes together quickly and easily. Here are a few pro-tips on making chow mein at home!,1. Prep all of your ingredients beforehand. You know, do that whole mise-en-place thing where everything that needs to be chopped is chopped and all the sauces are mixed in little bowls and everything is nice and neat and together, all within arms reach. Cooking goes quickly and it’s a lot easier to do when all your prep is done. That’s why in real kitchens there are prep chefs, so that the person cooking just gets to do the fun stuff: cooking.,
2. Don’t be afraid of heat, but also try not to burn stuff.,
3. Have fun!,Okay, that’s it. Hope you guys have chow mein in your future.,PS – This recipe is bomb for meal prep. Make it and eat it throughout the week!"

"You’re gonna want to make these ribs because they practically make themselves.,The other day ribs were on sale at the store. I was looking through the packages and an older man stopped to talk to me about them – he seemed really excited that they were so on sale. Then, while we were checking out, the checkout person also talked to us about them. I guess people really like ribs!,I love ribs too. I don’t know why I don’t make them,
more, they’re low effort and high reward, making them the perfect weeknight meal. These ribs were the little ribblet/spare rib kind. They come in 1-2 inch lengths and are usually still together as one big long piece. All you do is cut them into individual ribs and boom: spare ribs. If they don’t have any packs of these kind of ribs at the store, you can ask the butcher to cut regular ribs in half or you can just make full sized ribs too.,After a quick toss in some salt and pepper, and a dusting of cornstarch for crunch, the ribs go into the oven at high heat for 40 minutes with a flip right in the middle. During the last couple of minutes of baking, you heat up some oil and softly cook the garlic. For me, the more the better, but you can adjust as needed. Add a bit of honey, water, soy sauce, and the ribs, toss, and you’re ready to eat.,These ribs are crispy, meaty, and satisfying, coated in a sticky, garlicky, honey soy sauce. I almost always want to get honey garlic ribs when we order delivery and I’m so happy I’ve figured out a way to make these at home. We ate the whole batch while watching Youtube on a rare rainy day. It was so good."
"Now that local blueberries are starting to pop up everywhere, I’ve got blueberries on the brain. I love blueberry muffins, but since I’m still obsessed with loaves, I decided to take my favorite blueberry muffin recipe and loaf it up, small batch style. It came out wonderfully – cake-y and moist with pockets of blueberry jammy goodness and a crispy sugary top. I baked it up on a Tuesday, just in time to slice it up and wrap it into individual pieces to bring on our first summer camping trip!,They were the sweetest part of the trip, and not just because the other other things we ate were instant noodles and hot dogs. Usually I use vanilla with blueberry muffins and bread and such, but I ran out, so I used some almond extract instead and I think I almost liked it even better than vanilla. There’s something about almonds and blueberries that go together so perfectly.,Happy June!"

"It’s no secret that I LOVE Japanese soufflé pancakes. I dream about them. I doodle them. I make them. I eat them. I look at pictures of them. I like to think that I’m one the founding members of the I heart Japanese Fluffy Pancakes Club. That’s a non-existent club, by the way. But it shouldn’t be – should I start one? Anyway, I constantly look at fluffy pancakes. I follow the hashtag on Instagram. I’m always on the look out for new flavors, new cafes, and new ideas.,So, about a year ago, I saw what I thought was an ultimate soufflé pancake creation. Creme.brûlée.soufflé.pancakes. Soft and fluffy pancakes with a crispy crackly sugar crust!? I’m so in. Of course, the place that makes these glorious pancakes is in Hong Kong. I love Hong Kong. But we have no plane tickets to Hong Kong right now. So the next best thing is to make creme brûlée pancakes at home, right?,It’s a good thing I’ve been working on my pancake skills because I think if I tried this recipe first before getting the pancakes down would have been a case of trying run without knowing how to walk. But, if you’ve played around with soufflé pancakes and they come out tall and fluffy (or maybe even if they don’t but still taste good), I think you should give this a try.,I nailed it! I stacked up two fluffy pancakes, topped them off with creme anglais, sprinkled them with sugar, and torched it all to a burnished crackly crisp. Melt in your mouth pancakes covered with decadent creme and caramelized sugar. Seriously so good and no plane ride or massive line up. I’m starting to think I should open a soufflé pancake shop LOL.,Hope you get to give this a try and don’t forget to check out the , and the , for more pancake love and tips!"
"The other day Mike went out with a buddy of his and they had a conversation about the last five things they would want to eat before dying. When he came home and told me about it, I was like, “a morbid conversation about food obsessions?! I’m in.” I tried to guess Mike’s top 5 and only came up with 3 (burgers, sushi, and fried rice) so I guess I fail as a wife. Then again, I couldn’t even come up with my top 5 so maybe I just fail at being decisive?,Anyway, I was surprised that char siu wasn’t on Mike’s top five list because he’s told me before that char siu was his all time favorite food. But then he clarified that the fried rice would be BBQ pork fried rice and it all made sense.,Char siu happens to be one of my favorites too! Not good enough to make my top five list, but it’s definitely up there. It’s a total childhood comfort food for me as I can fondly remember many many nights were my mom would bring home Chinese bbq for us to eat with a giant pot of fluffy white rice.,Most Chinese peeps don’t make char siu at home. Why would we when it’s so easy to go to the Chinese BBQ to pick up ALL the delicious meats? I mean, I don’t know about you, but Chinese roast duck is a thing of glory.,Anyway, even though it’s easy enough to hop on over to the store, sometimes you happen to be in a place without a Chinese BBQ or maybe you just want to flex your cooking muscle a little bit. In those instances, you can make sweet and sticky char siu, right at home. It’s incredibly easy and even better than store-bought because you made it yourself!,The one that is a little annoying about this recipe is the red fermented bean curd. It’s what gives char siu it’s signature red hue. Red fermented bean curd, is essentially tofu that’s been preserved with red yeast rice or red rice koji. It doesn’t add a huge amount of flavor in the forefront, but it does add a hint of rich umami in the background. I wouldn’t say it’s essential, but if you have access to an Asian grocery store or shop online, I’d recommend getting a small jar.,Usually we just pop this in the oven on a wire rack but this time around we picked up some meat hooks in an attempt to be just like a classic Chinese BBQ place. And while it was kinda fun and looked really cool, it didn’t really add anything – the meat tasted the same as if it was just cooked on a rack and when the strips of char siu were hanging, it was hard to glaze. So, learn from my experiments and just go with the pork on a rack.,If you skip out on the meat hooks, this recipe is dead simple. Marinate, bake, glaze, rest, eat and repeat. Make sure you glaze a lot because the glaze is to die for!"
"Fun fact: I used to hate spicy food. When I was tiny, I would straight up refuse to eat anything that looked remotely spicy. I’m pretty sure it’s because when I was a baby my mom tried to wean me off my pacifier (yup, I had a paci and I loved it) she put hot sauce on it. She laughed so hard when she told me that story. “You asked for it one time and I put the hot sauce on it and you cried for hours!” Geez! What is it about moms laughing at their kids? Come to think about it, I kind of have a hang up about people laughing at me too, but that’s a story for another day.,Anyway, because spicy was on my would-not-eat list, I was never interested in those little glass jars of chili oil you see sitting at table at Chinese restaurants. You know the ones, with the tiny spoon and the metal lid? They looked so dangerously spicy to me: deep red with mysterious bits of dark things at the bottom of the jar. Nope, it was a solid pass for me.,Now though, I LOVE chili oil with a passion. Mike always says, “if I need to get you to say anything is tasty, I’ll just drown it in chili oil.” And it’s true! It was a long road to get to where I am now, I can officially say I’m a spice fiend. Well, except for scotch bonnets. I will not touch those. Actually, now that I think about it, I don’t think I can really say I’m a spice fiend because I’m pretty sure I would die if I ever ate any of the hot sauces from Hot Ones.,Chinese chili oil is actually not that hot in the grand scheme of hot sauces. It has just the right amount of warming heat with a pleasantly addictive flavor. And the best part about making your own is that you can adjust the aromatics and spice level just for you.,Speaking of aromatics, the secret to the deliciousness of Chinese chili oil is that the oil is infused with not just chili pepper flakes, but with ginger, bay leaves, star anise, and cinnamon too. Everyone’s aromatic mix is different and that’s why there’s so much variation when it comes to chili oils – just take a look at the chili oil section at your local Asian grocery store. It’s kind of overwhelming.,I like to go with a classic mix of aromatics and use Sichuan crushed chili flakes. Sichuan chili flakes are bright red and don’t have as many seeds in them, compared to the Italian-style crushed red pepper flakes. Sichuan flakes are made by toasting which gives them a nice nutty flavor.,Nothing beats homemade chili oil. It’s so much more fragrant and just miles better than store bought. I hope you make some and eat it on EVERTHING.,If you need some inspiration, here are a couple of recipes to get you started: ,, ,, ,, ,.,

"Green chile chicken enchiladas forever because who doesn’t love salsa verde, chicken, tortillas and cheese all baked up into a delicious mess. The best part is, if you don’t have the time to make the green chile sauce, it’s okay to buy it. Ditto on using leftover rotisserie chicken – this is meant to be easy! This easy chicken enchilada recipe is effortlessly customizable, so get creative and make it your own. Here are some suggestions:,Chicken: I usually have some poached boneless skinless cooked chicken breasts hanging out in the fridge, you can you can use any cooked chicken you like: boneless thighs, grilled chicken, baked chicken, even store bought rotisserie.,Aromatics: Onions, diced chilies like jalapeños or poblanos, garlic, anything that you like to spice it up – just sauté quickly and add it to the chicken filling.,Beans: Black beans, kidney beans, lentils, chickpeas, pinto beans, navy beans…it’s your choice. We usually go all chicken, but if you’re looking to pop in a bit more nutrition, beans are the way to go.,Tortillas: Traditionally enchiladas are made with corn tortillas, and that’s what we like best, but flour tortillas work too and bonus: they’re easier to roll.,Cheese: We always have a pack of shredded Mexican four cheese, so we usually reach for that, but of course any cheese will work: Pepper Jack, cheddar, Monterrey, mozzarella, anything melty.,Toppings: Here’s where you can get really creative! Cilantro, avocado, diced red onions, sour cream, crumbled cojita, pico de gallo, tomatoes, chiles, jalapeños, tomatoes, the more toppings the better."
"Do you love carbs? Do you love carbs wrapped in carbs? Then you’ll love zhaliang: a crispy doughy Chinese donut tucked inside a slippery, chewy rice noodle, doused with sweet soy and served with hoisin and creamy sesame sauce. They serve it up at dim sum and it’s consistently a must order for me and Mike.,If you too love noodles and eat all the noodle-y things, zhaliang is right up your alley. The rice noodles wrapped around the outsides are essentially giant sheets of rice noodles rolled up like a delicious savory fruit roll up. And the best part is, if you can’t wait in those super long dim sum lines, you can make this at home, easy.,The bestest and easiest way to make zhaliang is to buy the ingredients and put them together. It sounds like not cooking, but it absolutely is. You can totally homemake both the rice noodles and donuts, but even easier than steaming rice rolls and deep frying doughnuts at home is heading to the Asian grocery store and buying store bought ones.,The rice rolls (cheung fun) are kept in the refrigerator section and can be sold either in giant sheets folded up or pre-rolled. They’re called rice rolls or rice noodles and you want the ones that aren’t cut into strips. You’ll find the Chinese doughnuts (youtiao) in the bakery section. You tiao is THE BEST. What’s not to love about deep-fried dough? It’s like a breadstick but even better because it’s deep fried, crispy on the outside soft and doughy on the inside.,Once you have all your ingredients, all you have to do is put them together, douse them in sauce and devour. A couple of tips:,1. Toast the doughnuts to heat them up a bit so they taste nice and fresh. Before you toast them, split up them up – they come twinned, so you just want to separate them into single sticks for easy rolling.,
2. Warm up the rice rolls before unraveling and rolling. I usually do this in the microwave in 30 second intervals. You want them soft and pliable, but not burning hot, so just pop them in, heat them up, touch them and if they’re hard, keep going. When they’re hot, soft and squishy, they’re good to go.,
3. Don’t forget the sauces. The sauces are the best part because who doesn’t love carbs dipped in sauce? Traditionally they drizzle sweet soy sauce on top and serve it up with hoisin and creamy Chinese sesame paste for dipping.,Zhaliang are sweet and salty and a mix of slippery, chewy, and crisp, and really really good. I hope you make them soon because carb life.,In carbs we trust,,

"Mike and I watch this youtube channel where this dude v-logs his days with his corgi. It’s infinitely cute because I love corgis and even more cute because sometimes he makes his corgi dog-friendly food. This post has nothing to do with dog friendly food. But, the youtube dude did inspire me to try my hand at Gram-style Fluffy Japanese pancakes.,
I’ve been on the fluffy Japanese pancake bandwagon for a while now but even though I’ve been busy making loads of pancakes, today was the first time I tried making the kind of pancakes they serve at Gram.,Gram, just in case you didn’t know, is one of the premier pancake places in Japan. I’m sure you’ve seen them floating around the internet: three impossibly jiggly, tall pancakes that are almost like pancaked shaped angel food cakes. Gram is notoriously busy – they only serve their pancakes 3 times a day and they only sell a certain number of pancake plates. I think it’s because they take so long to make.,Anyway, there is finally a Gram open stateside, in San Francisco. And if you don’t want to wait in line to snag one of the 90 orders of pancakes a day, try making your own at home!,As far as I can tell, the batter for Gram pancakes are made much the same as other Japanese soufflé pancakes: with a well whipped meringue. The main difference is that theirs are piped into little parchment paper molds.,I looked really closely at the molds that they use, thanks to ,, and it looks like they’re regular parchment, stapled together using a staple-less stapler. We bought the one we used over at our local Daiso, but they sell them online too. From there it was just a question of piling the batter in and hoping for the best.,I did hit one little snafu, and that was that I only had enough batter for two pancakes instead of the classic three stack at Gram. But, all-in-all, not a bad mistake to make.,I held my breath as I flipped them and peeled off the foil and then the parchment. SUCCESS! I wish I had those giant fluffy plush pancakes they they have at Gram because I would just sink down into them with the satisfaction that Gram-like pancakes can be made at home.,I think Gram says it best: [The] premium pancake with texture sensations you’ve never experienced before, these soft and fluffy pancakes will melt in your mouth. We hope [these] pancakes can make you happy.,I was happy indeed :)"
"Takoyaki is THE PERFECT SNACK. I don’t know how many times Mike and I have stumbled home from a night out in Tokyo only to see the warm welcoming yellow lights and bright red awning of Gindado, Japan’s premier street side takoyaki stand. They’re the only ones open at 3 in the morning (okay, there are other places open, but for the purpose of this story, just pretend) and they are the ultimate drunk food. , This is street food at its best: a la minute, fast, friendly, so bad for you, but oh-so-good.,And the best thing about takoyaki is that they aren’t just drunk food! Takoyaki feature prominently in Japanese street festivals and as home cooking. You can’t go to any street fair in Japan without seeing a takoyaki vendor. I love having takoyaki in the streets, but I almost kind of sort of like making it at home even more? It seems like Japanese people agree with me because if you ever take a look on the appliances floor of any major electronics store in Japan, you’ll see at-home takoyaki machines. They’re little portable machines that plug in, heat up, and have the perfect little half spherical depressions for making takoyaki. I did an informal poll of my friends living in Japan and almost all of them have one for the express purpose of making takoyaki at home.,There’s something so fun and cozy about having a takoyaki party with family or friends. You pop a takoyaki machine in the middle of the table, get all the ingredients ready, then make takoyaki and eat and chat the day and night away. You can keep it interesting by having all different kinds of fillings and toppings so everyone can customize. You can even have a takoyaki-off where everyone creates their own and have a taste test to choose the winner.,If you’ve never made them before, it takes a little finesse, but that’s part of the fun. Sometimes Mike and I will have a takoyaki date, just the two of us and it’s kind of the. best because unlike the street vendors, you can put in whatever you like. I love tako (octopus) but we’ve also done chicken, shrimp, pork, beef, and even hot dogs. One variation we both love is taco takoyaki: seasoned ground beef, cheese, tomatoes – you know, all the good stuff from hard shell tacos, but inside a little takoyaki ball. I especially love cheese in takoyaki. It’s melty in the middle and gets crispy on the outside edges. Takoyaki heaven!,Takoyaki Tips,Happy takoyaki-ing!,PS – If you want to be super authentic, you can just go ahead and buy the packaged takoyaki flour. You just add eggs and water and personally it’s what we buy when we’re in Tokyo and I see lots of other families buying it too."
"If you’ve ever had a salad in a Japanese restaurant or had a Japanese bento, you’ve probably wondered, “how the heck do they make salad taste so good?” The answer is wafu. Wafu means Japanese style, so wafu dressing is Japanese style salad dressing made from rice vinegar, soy, and oil.,There are a bunch of different wafu dressings out there but this is one of my all time favorites. I like to make a big batch and pop it into a speed bottle in the fridge and just drizzle it over everything. It’s savory and tart and sweet and so good. It tastes especially amazing with lettuces and cabbage, tomatoes, and cucumbers.,Lately I’ve been eating cabbage. Like A LOT OF CABBAGE. I don’t know how or why I decided on it, but cabbage is now my favorite vegetable. It tastes amazing and I eat it wherever/whenever I want carbs. Instead of noodles, I’ve been reaching for cabbage. Instead of rice, it’s cabbage time. Instead of bread, I’ve been going for, you got it, cabbage.,We buy a head of cabbage and then I spend a good 15 minutes using the mandoline to shred it into the perfect most fluffiest salad ever. It’s perfect for topping things with and it is my favorite way to eat cabbage because it reminds me of the fluffy shredded cabbage that comes with Japanese tonkatsu. The dressing just takes it over the top because it’s just like the dressing they give you at tonkatsu, in that little bottle that you use to dress the cabbage yourself.,Cabbages forever!"
"Hello Friday! The week always feels a little weird to me when there’s a holiday right in the middle. Does anyone else ever feel like that? Kinda like the equilibrium of work to fun is off? Sometimes I get itchy when there’s too much fun and no play. But then again, I definitely go crazy when it’s all work and no play. Geez, am I complicated much?,Anyway, musings on work-life-balance aside, I’ve been keeping busy this week: I baked yet another Japanese cotton cheesecake (new recipe coming soon), made a bunch of different bbq meat marinades, and decided to go on the keto diet. Totally not in line what’s on this blog (,), but I needed a kick in the butt and keto is definitely it. I’ll be posting some fun keto recipes just because that’s obviously on my mind lately, but I still be doing regular posts because Mike can eat all the regular foods. Plus Mike will still be doing the ever awesome , so not much is going to change at all.,Speaking of Mike, this no peanut kung pao chicken stir fry is dedicated to him: my all time favorite peanut allergic person. Mike’s allergy is not so crazy that we need to keep peanuts out of the house, but I keep them out of the house anyway because Mike doesn’t like the way they smell and honestly, it’s not that big of a deal to be peanut free. Although, I do admit, sometimes I have peanut butter toast when I’m out without him. Don’t worry, I brush my teeth really good when I get home.,Still, one thing that kind of sucks about Mike’s peanut allergy is that we tend to avoid Sichuan food, especially in the super authentic places where they play fast and loose with people’s food allergies. It’s too bad because Mike loves spicy food and I love spicy Sichuan peppers. The only thing to do when you can’t go out though…is stay in. Instead of potentially getting peanuts in our food, we stay in and have spicy Sichuan night, right at home.,On the menu is always , and lately, we’ve also been doing this Kung Pao chicken too. This particular Kung Pao isn’t super authentic, not quite the way it’s made in Sichuan and not just because it’s peanut free. Instead of going the classic route, I riffed off of takeout style Kung Pao.,This stir fry comes together super quick and easy, but that’s only , you prep all of the ingredients. If you want do this faster than takeout will arrive at your door, you’ve got to have everything in order before you even start cooking.,1. First off, you’ve got to make rice. Unless you’ve smart and have rice meal prepped in your fridge. Then in that case, skip this step because you’re already winning at life.,
2. Cut up your chicken into bite sized pieces and place in a bowl with the marinade and set aside while your prep the sauce ingredients.,
3. Prep the aromatics and whisk up all the sauce ingredients in a small bowl or liquid measuring cup. This is the step that will probably take the most time if you’re not really a prep machine. Use a garlic press for the garlic and a ginger grater for the ginger. Both are a huge time saver. This recipe has the green onions cut into sections, so that’s pretty fast.,
4. Once everything’s ready, it’s just a quick stir fry and it’s done. I like to use a non-stick pan because cornstarch has the tendency to stick to regular pans and with a non-stick you have the option of not using as much oil. I know that some people think that non-stick pans are not professional, because they don’t give you the same kind of maillard reaction you’d get with a regular pan, but when you’re making stir fry, not steak, it’s not really an issue. Plus, the name of the game is ease and if you have an annoyingly difficult to wash pan after dinner is done, that’s not easy. (, are my favorite.),Bonus Pro Tip – It’s annoying, but nice to have two cutting boards that are dishwasher safe (and with feet, so they don’t slip) so you don’t have to cut up your vegetables first before cutting your meat. With two cutting boards, you can cut your chicken, pop that cutting board in the dishwasher, then move on to your second cutting board to prep the aromatics without worrying about cross contamination. (,),Once everything’s prepped, it takes just a couple of minutes to cook – basically once the chicken is cooked through, about 5-6 minutes on medium high, you add the sauce, let it reduce a bit 2-3 minutes, and you’re ready to eat.,I swapped out the peanuts for cashews and Mike loved the little crunch they added. You could do peanuts if you like them or you could leave out the nuts entirely. Either way this recipe’s a winner. Hope you give it a try!"
"I am straight up obsessed with chocolate chip cookies. I don’t think there is any other quintessential cookie out there. I think I would even go as far as saying that in a game of , of chocolate chip cookies, peanut butter, and oatmeal raisin, I’d definitely M chocolate chip cookies, F oatmeal raisin, and K peanut butter. They’re just that good. If I could only ever have one cookie for the rest of my life, it would be chocolate chip.,There are over , (some of them are slight variations, but all with chocolate chip cookie bases) and I think it’s safe to say that I have tested and made a LOT of chocolate chip cookies in my life. The thing is, every single time I think I’ve found ,, I can’t help but wonder if there’s something better out there. Damn, now that I think about it, I have cookie commitment issues. But, I think I’ve found it guys. I think this cookie is absolutely ,. I know I’ve said it before, so don’t think of me as some sort of thirsty cookie lover because this time I’m sure of it. ,The caramelization of the combination of the two sugars, the nuttiness of the browned butter, the immense amount of pools of melted chocolate…swoon. It has slightly crisp buttery edges with a hint of toffee and a soft, dense and chewy center barely held together because of all the chocolate. The tops are craggy with those ever instagramable ripples and it’s just the perfect balance between sweet and salty. This cookie makes my heart beat a little faster. Cue the heavy breathing. SO GOOD.,The recipe is an amalgamation of all the cookies that have come before it. It stands of the shoulders of giants. In honor of all the cookies I’ve loved before, this is it: my best salted brown butter chocolate chip cookie recipe.,Browned butter in chocolate chip cookies is definitely a thing and I happen to like the little hint of hazelnut nuttiness it adds, but only if you brown the butter just enough. Plus, there’s the bonus of not having to wait for your butter to come to room temperature when you want cookies. Just make sure you keep an eye on the butter –you can definitely go too far and have blackish bits in your browned butter, which are a big no for me. I like to brown just to the point where there are little flecks of brown. Of course, when you brown butter, you lose moisture, so a la Bon Appétit, that moisture is added back in with an extra pat or two of butter after the butter is browned. The extra pat of butter helps cool down the butter too, which is awesome because you don’t want your cookie dough too warm.,Aside from the brown butter, I’d say I have a moderate amount of flour (the amount of flour is what determines if you have a thin or thick cookie) to a very specific amount of brown vs. white sugar. The amount of brown sugar is 3 times the amount of the white. According to the wisdom of the internet, cookies with more brown sugar end up tall and moist, while cookies with more white sugar end up thin and crisp. It’s a science thing. My kind of cookie is on the thicker side but not obscenely thicc like a Levain cookie – that just takes it too far.,Of course you can’t talk about chocolate chip cookies without talking about the chocolate. Chopped chocolate is key to these cookies. No more chocolate chips: just say no! Buy a chunk of semi sweet dark chocolate (we routinely have a Callebaut 811 semisweet dark chocolate slab in the pantry) and chop it yourself. You want that mix of large chunks and thin chocolate shavings to distribute themselves through the cookies so you have barely there streaks of chocolate in the dough to give the cookie a more chocolatey flavor and large chunks to melt into giant gooey pools. Eight ounces seems like the perfect amount of chocolate. You might feel like there’s not enough dough to take all the chocolate, but trust me, there is.,Lastly, how you shape your cookies before baking is essential to how they come out after baking. If you want a thick and craggy cookie with ripples (like Sarah Keiffer’s famous pan-banging cookies) shape your cookies into little logs/cookie ghosties. These won’t come out quite as ripple-y and ridge-y as the pan banging cookies which are a bit thinner and have you removing and banging the cookies as they bake, but they do have a pleasing ripple or two on the outer edges making them pretty. My favorite way of shaping the balls of dough is using my trusty 1.5 tablespoon cookie scoop. I scoop out one ball of dough (with the dough flush to the scoop, so it’s flat bottomed), making sure to get a giant chocolate chunk in there, and place it on a parchment paper lined baking sheet. Then I scoop out another ball of dough (again with a large chunk of chocolate) and then smoosh it on top of the other ball, flattening the bottom ball just the tiniest bit. They end up looking like ghosties with a slightly larger bottom and a tall top.,When you bake the ghosties, the bottoms spread out slowly and it’ll look like they won’t spread out as large as you want them too, but give them time. The tops of the ghosties will melt down during the final few minutes of baking until everything is uniformly level. When you take the cookies out of the oven, they’ll still be a bit soft and puffy. This is when you bang them against the counter to deflate them a little bit and give them the rings. One or two bangs should do it, then you let the cookies cool on the baking sheet.,There you have it! My all time new favorite, salted browned butter chocolate chip cookies. Essentially this is a remake of ,: made sexier with some brown butter, extra (and better) chocolate, and a more pleasing modern cookie shape. Cheers to always improving!,I implore you to try this recipe and let me know what you think. Am I crazy or is this cookie the one? For all of you who don’t want to commit to a whole recipe, I also included a small batch recipe as well :)"
"All summer long, when I was a kid, I simultaneously looked forward to and dreaded my mom’s barbecues. They were epic: loads of people, and all the food you could ever possibly want to eat. My favorite thing, and everyone else’s too, it seemed, was the chicken satay. Bright yellow, glistening, charred juicy skewers of chicken, just begging to be dipped into creamy, nutty sauce.,The reason I both loved and feared the barbecues was because I would be the one, in the days before the party, skewering hundreds, no, thousands of skewers of chicken. Okay, okay, maybe I’m exaggerating. But, seriously, it was in the hundreds for sure. My hands would get stained yellow and I would have this uncontrollable urge to constantly smelling my fingers because they smelled cumin – i hated it! It was sad but it was also worth it because food?,Anyway, thankfully I don’t live at home anymore so I’m not tasked with skewering all of the chicken. I still skewer satay, but on a much more smaller scale, just for me and Mike. I always use gloves too – my hands stay un-yellow and I don’t have to smell like cumin for the rest of the day. Win-win. Also win is eating these gorgeously charred, juicy sticks of chicken. I feel like I could eat 20 sticks, just by myself. Just give me a vat of no-peanut peanut sauce, ALL the satay, and maybe a roti or two and I’m the happiest you’ve ever seen.,Speaking of the no-peanut peanut sauce, it’s just a little variation I came up with because Mike is allergic to peanuts. I love it so much that between the two, I wouldn’t go for peanut sauce even if it was there. The roasted cashews add a deep creamy nuttiness, the Thai red curry paste adds just the right amount of kick, and the coconut milk brings everything together. I feel like I could just use a spoon and eat it, it’s that good.,Anyway, hope you’re barbecuing out there. And hope chicken satay is on the menu!,chicken satays and roti,,

"I love tacos, especially their hand-held qualities. Nothing beats grabbing a taco and shoving it in my mouth. When I started on this keto journey I thought that I’d have to give them up and just be eating bowls, but then, after snacking on some egg ribbons, I thought about egg crepes and then I thought, what if I make the crepes mini, like the size of tortillas and here we are!,There are a ton of keto tacos online but most of the taco shells I saw online were for crunchy hard shell tacos made of cheese. I wanted those classic street tacos you get at your favorite food truck, in the middle of the night. Enter this keto Instant Pot carnitas inspired street tacos recipe! These little egg tortillas (just two ingredients!) were perfect because they fold up just like regular tortillas and have zero net carbs.,I filled them up with a carnitas inspired pork made quick and easy in the Instant Pot and topped them off with just the tiniest amount of chopped cilantro, onions, and jalapeños. A little bit of of leftover cooking sauce on top and these guys were insanely good. Even Mike liked them, although he thought they tasted like breakfast tacos LOL.,Macros per taco: 0 net carbs, 10 grams fat, 16 grams protein"
"The other day I got a text: can you send me your potato salad recipe? I mean, it was totally plausible that it was from a friend, but I didn’t recognize the number so I asked, “who dis?” Turns out it was a wrong number text but I offered them a potato salad recipe anyway because, why not? I thought it was hilarious and cute and so so perfect because I love potato salad so much and it reminded me that there isn’t a classic picnic potato salad recipe on the blog.,So, the next day I bought some potatoes and here we are, perfect picnic potato salad. I’m a creamy mayo potato salad kinda girl. Don’t get me wrong, I like potato salads with yogurt and sour cream too, but something about barbecues and picnics means classic creamy potato salad with lots of crunchy things.,The key to a good potato salad is the potatoes, of course. I like to use yellow flesh potatoes (Yukon golds are my potato of choice) and I always boil them skin on so they don’t get too soggy. Plus it’s really easy to peel potato skins off after they’ve been cooked. I learned that one from my mom – I remember her peeling potatoes after cooking them and now I do it too. Cooking them skin on also helps keep the potatoes more potato-y flavored, probably because the potatoes don’t get water logged.,Anyway, after peeling the potatoes and roughly chunking them up, sprinkle on a bit of rice vinegar while the potatoes are still hot so they can absorb that awesome tartness and have a secret hidden punch. Rice vinegar is my favorite of all the vinegars, just the right amount of tart.,You definitely need crunchy celery and a bit of onions as well. I go between red onions and green onions. If you like a milder onion flavor, do the green onions and if you like more crunch and sharpness, do the red onions. Sometimes I even do both. I also like using kewpie mayo because it is just so much more delicious than regular. It really adds that extra something!,Happy potato salad making :)"
"If you’re looking for a weeknight meatball, this is it: no chopping, one bowl, baked meatballs! They’re perfect because you can mix them up, pop them in the oven and skip out on standing next to the stove to sauté.,Is there anyone who doesn’t love meatballs? I don’t know what it is about little balls of meat, but damn, they’re good. I’m pretty sure every culture out there has a meatball and I’m in love with all of them. I feel like I didn’t get to eat a lot of meatballs growing up because my mom didn’t make them and as I kid I couldn’t really figure out how meatballs even existed. I’m embarrassed to admit that I kind of sort of though they were an animal? Like how chicken wings come from chickens, I thought meatballs were from little meatball animals. I was a super weird kid.,Anyway, meatballs are a staple around here because we always have some frozen in the freezer for a quick and easy meal. In the past, I’ve definitely been known to buy a bag or two of Ikea meatballs, but now that I’m an expert Swedish meatball maker, I just make a double batch and freeze them. This recipe is a little less involved than the Swedish (thank goodness) and perfect for making on a weeknight. It’s even a little stress reducing because you have to squish everything together, like a stress (meat) ball.,The reason they’re prefect for weeknights is because NO CHOPPING. Ever since I’ve been making these air fryer Vietnamese chicken wings, I’ve been incorporating more and more garlic and onion powder into recipes. I think they’re awesome! All the onion and garlic flavor and none of the chopping. And the best part is, all they are is literally dehydrated garlic and onion. There’s nothing else in them. The dehydrating gives them a bit more of an intense flavor than fresh and when I’m in a hurry and can’t chop, garlic and onion powders are a life saver.,After you mix and shape the meatballs, it’s just a quick oven bake. For this specific purpose, oven baking meatballs is the best way to cook meatballs – you can cook a big batch all at once and every single meatball is evenly cooked at the same time. No more batch frying meatballs, which we all know is the most annoying part.,After they’re done, eat them straight, sauce them, pair them with your favorite carb (noodles, rice, bread) and boom. Happiness is just a meatball away.,PS – We tossed them in some chili oil for a bit of a deconstructed siu mai kind of situation and DAMN, they were so good."
"Oh hai! If you’ve been a long time reader, you might be wondering why there are a bunch of keto recipes all of a sudden. Believe me, it was surprising to me too. I mean, I LOVE carbs with a passion. I even have a sweatshirt with “Carb Enthusiast” on the front of it. But, even though I love carbs, they don’t love me. I was starting to get a little too fluffy from all the fluffy pancakes (SO GOOD). For a long time I was kind of frustrated but didn’t know what to do about it, but I don’t know, finally something inside me just clicked and that really old (kinda offensive) Kate Moss saying came to me: nothing tastes as good as skinny feels.,Anyway, Mike suggested I try keto and here we are. He actually suggested it years ago but I take a really long time to warm to things. I mean, give up my beloved carbs?! But now that I in, I’m all in. I even resisted the huge plate of fries that Mike had the other day. It’s only been 5 days so far so we’ll see how long this lasts before I go back to #carblife. But, for now, I hope you stick around and get inspired to eat a little more low carb, if not keto. The keto world is wild and I’ve been having fun tracking my macros (fats and proteins and net carbs). And I’ve been seeing results which is what makes it so satisfying. It’s like gamifying my weight and I gotta say, I’m a sucker for gamified anything.,Ever since I started keto all my google searches have been some variation of: is _______ okay on keto? One of the searches that I keep looking at pages and pages of results for is: is oyster sauce keto friendly? The answer is no, but I kept looking because I wanted the answer to be yes. The thing is, if you’re restricting carbs only, then technically you could probably get away with having oyster sauce. There’s about 2 grams in a 1 tablespoon serving, which doesn’t sound so bad but the thing is that most of the carbs come from sugar which is a huge NO for keto. But, I gave in anyway and make this keto friendly low carb beef and broccoli stir fry with oyster sauce because I kept it to 1 tablespoon for 2 servings. I told myself: live a little! Of course you can try this without oyster sauce if you have more self control than me. It’ll still taste good, just not super authentic.,I loved this easy keto friendly low carb beef and broccoli stir fry, especially with cauliflower rice! Even Mike said it was good. It comes together super fast, especially if you buy stir-fry beef that’s pre-cut at the grocery store. Then, most of your prep time is just using a garlic crusher and grating ginger. I’ve been meal prepping whole cauliflowers as cauliflower rice and that’s been a game changer too because when it’s time to eat, it’s just a question of heating it up. Perfect for when I get too hangry to function.,PS – Here are the macros for this guy (not including the cauliflower rice): 6 grams net carbs, 16 grams fat, 38 grams protein. I used my kitchen scale and Carb Manager to calculate and if you’re anything like me (super exacting), I suggest you enter your food weights yourself so you know exactly what you’re getting."

"One of Mike’s favorite foods in the whole wide world is fried rice. Specifically Yang Chow fried rice. When we get take out, you better believe that there’s an order of Yang Chow fried rice in there. I even think that Mike has an index of all the good Yang Chow fried rices out there.,Generally, Yang Chow fried rice is a kind of house special fried rice. Originally it was a fried rice dish that came from the city of Yangzhou, but now basically every Chinese restaurant has their own version of Yang Chow. It’s the perfect clean out your fridge kind of meal. That being said, there are some typical Yang Chow fried rice ingredients, specifically eggs and protein, usually in the form of pork or chicken, and shrimp, always shrimp. Yang Chow is the surf and turf of fried rices and this Yang Chow fried rice recipe will having you making the best Chinese surf and turf in your life.,Make this at home because what’s better than a recipe that comes together in just 15 minutes? If you have all of your ingredients prepped beforehand, this meal is almost instant. The next time you’re doing meal prep for the week, make some extra rice and chop up some Chinese sausage – you’ll be halfway to homemade weeknight fried rice."
"Last week it was my brother’s birthday and I thought I’d make him a cheesecake because ever since he was little, he’s been a cheesecake fan. Usually his jam is a classic rich and dense New York style cheesecake, but I thought I’d bring a fluffy jiggly cotton cheesecake/Japanese cheese over for something different. Most years we celebrate with an ice cream cake (I love the fudge and chocolate crunchies layer in a classic DQ cake) or a tuxedo cake (maybe my all time favorite store bought cake LOL) but ever since I made the small batch cotton cheesecake,, I’ve been itching to try again, so here we are.,I watched a huge amount of youtube videos because my last Japanese cheesecake, while super delicious, came out a little wrinkly and cracked on top. I’m not usually one to be super finicky about the way my bakes look (hello food that doesn’t look good but tastes good) but when you’re making something for someone else, aesthetics are something you need to consider. Actually, in truth, I should consider aesthetics more. Mike always makes fun of me because I love brown food so much. Or mushy looking food. You know, food that really doesn’t look appealing but tastes amazing.,Anyway, this cake looked pretty darn cute and squishy (even though it looked like a mushroom) and it tasted good too. Or so I’m told. I’m still doing keto so I didn’t taste it and had to rely on everyone else telling me how it was. It baked up beautifully and didn’t crack and how the inside texture looked was bang on. The key was baking it at different temperatures. It starts off high so it can get a lot of heat to help it rise, then goes low and slow so everything bakes evenly.,After the baking, the cheesecake takes an enormously long time to cool off in the oven. I’m pretty sure this is not how they do it in Japan at Uncle Tetsu because they take them out of the oven when they’re still super hot and jiggly, but this worked for me so I rolled with it. The only thing is, when you cool it in the oven, you don’t get to have fun jiggling it while it’s still hot. And really, the cheesecake is most jiggly when it’s warm. After it cools down, it deflates a bit and is more like a regular fluffy sponge cake texture rather than a jiggly puffball.,Anyway, everyone loved it! My littlest nephew liked it over the store bought cake and gave me a very serious food review: it’s like a sponge. When I squish it, I can feel that it’s wet. It’s yummy! My brother really liked it too and my mom said it tasted just like the Uncle Tetsu’s Japanese cheesecake she lined up for.,The only sad thing was that I didn’t eat any! But, as a consolation prize to myself, I made a keto fluffy cotton cheesecake, with no flour and cornstarch and just the tiniest bit of keto friendly sugar free sweetener. It wasn’t as pretty, but it satisfied the craving.,This recipe is a keeper – I’m totally going to make it again. And the more I make it, the fluffier it’ll be. Lately I’ve been really into making the same thing over and over and over again, kinda like the soufflé pancakes. You know what they say about being an expert: 10,000 hours will make you one. Only like 99,998 more cotton cheesecakes to go!"
"Summer is the season of not doing very much to your food to get it looking and tasting great. This pasta uses everything in season and not much else, and it tastes happy and amazing, kind of like if this pasta was an avenger, it’d be spiderman. Think perfectly cooked salmon, zucchini with just a tiny bit of bite, and both fresh and roasted tomatoes to get you that one-two hit of sweetness and brightness, all in something like 15 minutes and zero effort.,I peeled the zucchini with a vegetable peeler, which wasn’t a lot of work but was mainly for aesthetic reasons, so feel free to omit this step. I also roasted the salmon with the skin on to protect it, but removed it (and ate it) because I didn’t think the pasta would look or taste as fresh with it around, but feel free to leave it on.,The salmon I used here is wild caught sockeye, which is in peak right now, but use whatever salmon or other fish you like, this is dinner and chill after all.,On the other hand, it’s important to use high quality olive oil (first press or extra virgin) and proper Parmigiano Reggiano (with the laser imprinted rind and heavenly smell) for best results.,A baking pan, nonstick skillet, and a pot to boil pasta in. A microplane is awesome but any old grater will do.,Garnish with chopped Italian parsley and lemon zest – I used the same microplane on both the cheese and the lemon without washing in between."
"I am super digging the keto lifestyle. I thought I would die (because #carblife) but really, I’ve been great! It’s been over two weeks now and while I did get that whole dreaded keto flu and some weird leg cramp thing, other than that, it’s been great. I’m pretty much killing it. I love it because it forces me to eat real food that I’ve made myself instead of falling back on my favorite store bought snacks and baddies.,Of course, I still love noodles and noodle shaped things so of course shirataki noodles are in my mix. Have you ever had shirataki noodles? Or konnyaku/konjac? It’s AMAZING. Konnyaku/konjac is a Japanese food (it translates as yam cake) that is super low calorie and super low carb. It’s made from a plant from the taro/yam family but is nothing like taro or yam. Japanese people have been eating it for ages – literally since the 6th century. It comes in both cake (block) form and noodle form.,The block form is usually cut into cubes and stewed in oden, a warm and comforting Japanese stew. In noodle form, you’ll find it as shirataki, which comes in many different noodle shapes. Shirataki have been touted as miracle noodles, zero calorie noodles, low carb noodles – you name it, they’ve been called it. If you haven’t had them before, they’re slick and slippery, and kind of flavorless, but they take on massive loads of flavor. Texture-wise, they kind of remind me of a firm jelly. I love konnyaku and shirataki so it’s no wonder that I’ve incorporated them into my keto diet. They go exceptionally well in soups, stews, stir-fries, and basically anything Asian.,I have read a bunch of stuff on the internet about how shirataki noodles are disgusting and how you have to do a bunch of things to them to make them edible (boil in lemon juice, dry fry, rinse under running water for 20 minutes) but really I don’t understand where all of that is coming from. Perhaps it’s a cultural or expectation thing. Don’t think that shirataki are going to taste like pasta or regular noodles. They won’t. They’re literally made from a plant so they won’t have the same texture at all. Also, most Asian countries really like that firm, kind of chewy, squeaky texture so it’s no wonder that they use and eat shirataki on the regular. I mean, I can even just eat shirataki bundles in just chicken stock or dashi, it’s that good to me.,If you haven’t had them, I hope you give them a try. If you’ve ever asked yourself, “what can I make with shirataki noodles,” this is it! They really mimic the feel of eating noodles, they’re low carb, and … I don’t see any downsides. This chicken shirataki noodle stir fry was amazing. Marinating the chicken thighs in soy and toasted sesame oil makes them brown nicely, as well as giving them ultimate flavor. The swiss chard and mushrooms are a nice balance and the noodles pull everything together. Not bad for just 2 net carbs!,Macros: 2 net carbs, 16 grams fat, 26 grams protein. As always, weigh your own foods to figure out the exact macros for your dish."
"Date night shouldn’t be a stressful thing, and it shouldn’t be either boring or too experimental either. As long as your date is ok with cilantro, this one is a surefire date pleaser that can be done strictly by the numbers. Smoky, seared, perfectly medium rare steaks, a savory japanese inspired take on chimichurri, jammy eggs and a luxurious roasted and seared bone marrow will ensure a stress-free successful dinner that’s neither too heavy nor will result in a food coma.,I’ve done this steak a bunch of times now, at 200ºF, it takes 40 min on the steak total, and at 350ºF, it takes 20 minutes, both times are for a decent 1 1/2” higher end supermarket steak. If your oven goes that low and you have the time to spare, the 200ºF will produce a more evenly cooked steak, but to be really honest, I don’t think it’s always worth the extra time.,I like to get my steaks to 115ºF, which is a perfect medium rare after searing. Steaks don’t need to be rare if they are high quality, and can often be off-putting if you don’t know for sure that the other person likes their steaks rare. Medium rare is always a safer choice. If you’re cooking on 200ºF, near the end the steak tends to go up 1 degree per minute. , is your friend here, and they are cheap.,Sear your steaks 1 minute per side if using a stainless steel pan, and 30s per side if using cast iron. In both cases, use a liberal amount of high heat oil and allow the oil to get hot enough to just about start smoking. Turn on your exhaust fans, open some windows, and be ready to fan smoke away from your smoke detector. , is highly recommended.,Boiling the eggs ahead of time and then storing them unpeeled in the fridge will make both cutting and peeling them much much easier.,Bone marrow is usually very easy to find at any major grocery store, but if they don’t have any out, ask the butcher shop for soup bones.,A high sided baking pan, a rack, and a cast iron or stainless steel skillet (or any skillet without a non stick coating). Things that will make your life easy and awesome: a cheap splatter screen and meat thermometer. Tiny spoons for the bone marrow would work great as well.,Just what’s here."

"It’s blueberry season! Give me all the blueberries because they remind me of the best days of summer: long lazy afternoons spent eating still warm from the sun berries, my fingers stained with the most delicious juice.,
,
My mom has 8 little blueberry bushes in her backyard and every summer (if we’re in town), she gives a bunch of berries. They’re super sweet and jumbo sized. And, as she loves telling me: completely organic. I think it’s so cute how my mom has a little garden and is so proud of what she grows. When she was little, she always had to help my grandma in the garden – she hated it back then – she always tells me stories about how poor they were and how growing vegetables to sell at the market was torturous on an empty stomach.,Now, we all have plenty to eat and my mom loves her garden. It amazes me so much to think of what my parents (and Mike’s) have accomplished. Mike and I always talk about how crazy and difficult it would be to immigrate to a completely foreign country. And in a time without internet so you couldn’t exactly google things like: how do I enroll my kids in kindergarten or where to buy Asian groceries. I’m so proud of our parents and all the hard work they’ve done so that we’re all where we are today. They’re my heroes.,I didn’t get these blueberries from my mom – hers weren’t ripe yet, but there were lots and lots of berries at the farmer’s market and I have the tendency to over buy berries. When that happens, I make all the blueberry things: ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, and now these oat bars.,Do you love oat bars? I admit, I’ve definitely bought one or two (or twenty) Starbucks blueberry oat bars. Buttery crumble, juicy berries, and a thick and oat-y base? Yes please! These guys are slightly reminiscent of the Starbucks bars but with some extra nutty, extra delicious browned butter thrown into the mix. I like how the base of these bars and the topping is the same. All you do is mix everything up in bowl, and press the oat mixture into a pan, top with berries, and then sprinkle on the remaining oats. Super simple and super tasty. I went with a half batch, conveniently made in a loaf pan because I love small batch baked goods – the more small batch, the more opportunity for baking, and the more variety! I cut the square up extra small too so they were literally 1 bite oat bars. Perfect for sneaking a bite here and there. I like keeping them in the fridge, especially in the summer for a nice cold bite.,Hope you’re summering hard :)"
"EEE!! Sometimes I make something and it turns out just the way I want and I get over the moon giddy about it. These bubble waffle cones/puffle cones/eggloo egg waffle cones were totally just how I wanted them to be. Confession: before this, I’ve never had a puffle cone. I think I’ve had literally thousands of egg waffles – they’re one of my all time favorite Hong Kong style treats – but shaped into a cone and filled with ice cream? Nope. Of course, all the awesome looking puffle cone places are far away – Cauldron Ice Cream in Santa Ana, Eggloo in NYC – so I just had to make some for myself.,Bubble waffles are easy to make, with just one caveat: you need a bubble waffle maker. I’ve had several due to my bubble waffle obsession and I can say, hands down, my favorite is this electric one. The kind that interlock that you use over the stove work well too but it’s a lot harder to maintain the right amount of heat and you have to work a lot more quickly. I imagine the professional twirly ones they use in the streets of Hong Kong would be awesome to use too but I don’t think my home could fit another waffle maker.,Anyway, once you have your bubble waffle maker, it’s just a question of the batter. I went with a hybrid of a classic Hong Kong egg waffle batter and a lightened up waffle batter. Most HK egg waffles don’t have you whip up egg whites but I find that it lends a light and fluffy crispiness to the waffles. The key ingredient, if you want your waffles to taste like the ones you get out is the custard powder. You can find it at most grocery stores (or on Amazon), but it is kind of a weird retro British ingredient. It’s what adds that extra eggy custard-y quality to the waffle. Otherwise it’ll taste just like a regular waffle. A good waffle, but a regular good sweet waffle.,Once you have your waffle iron and batter sorted out, you’ll want something to help you shape your cones. I made little paper cones that worked really well, but you can also just cone them up and put them in a tall glass to help hold their shape too. From there it’s just a question of filling them with your favorite ice cream and toppings. I went with some Strawberry Pocky, sprinkles, and a delicious roll cookie. Super cute, fun, and delicious.,These would be so awesome to make with a bunch of friends on a summer evening. The combinations are endless. Summertime forever!,A note on how long to cook the waffles: if you want them on the softer side, let them just go to golden brown and let them cool naturally in the cone shape. Typically HK egg waffles are a combination of crispy edges and soft and chewy bubbles. If you want more of that texture, make sure to cook the waffles a little longer. Also, after you cook them and they’ve been shaped, cool them rapidly by fanning them with a fan or magazine – it really helps everything crisp up to the right texture and it’s how you see street vendors doing it in Hong Kong.,PS – , we have!"
"Mike and I are currently road tripping and camping and it’s been a hilarious trip so far, with me trying to eat keto (my car snacks are macadamia nuts and carb free cheese crips) and various things breaking down that need to be fixed. Still, we’re having an awesome time. There’s something about being in a car that forces you to have deep conversations that you might not otherwise have. Conversations about things like your feelings on roadside attractions (both in favor) and pad Thai.,I’m a huge fan of pad Thai. I’m sure you’ve had it, but if you haven’t, pad Thai is a combination of rice noodles, palm sugar, tamarind, fish sauce, and crushed chilis. It’s dish that’s balanced between sweet and savory, sour and spicy. At it’s heart, it’s street food but it’s been elevated too. It’s a noodle dish I think everyone has at least heard of, if not a dish that everyone loves.,It’s also a dish that has a lot of different variations, especially between America and Thailand. If you go to Thailand expecting a dish similar to what you get in America, you’ll be surprised. The thing about authentic pad Thai is, it’s not quite like what you’ll find at your local delivery/takeout joint. Namely, it’s not red and it doesn’t have any ketchup in it.,Traditional Pad Thai sauce is actually really simple: tamarind, sugar (usually coconut palm sugar), and fish sauce. That’s it. It’s tangy, sweet, and deeply savory all at the same time. While pad Thai in Thailand might differ in ingredients – some might have eggs, some might have dried shrimp, some might have peanuts, some might have tofu – the thing that stays consistent is the sauce. Bonus, the sauce is an easy three ingredient affair.,If you make a lot of Thai or Vietnamese food you’ll probably have fish sauce at home. Tamarind paste on the other hand, is a little bit more specific. Thankfully, you can easily find tamarind paste (it comes in a jar) in Asian grocery stores or on amazon. It’s what adds that unique tangy taste to pad Thai. If you don’t want to buy it and you’re not picky about authenticity, I’ve heard that a mix of ketchup and rice vinegar can kind of come close. I haven’t tried that though, so I’m not sure about it.,What is definitely optional are the roasted peanuts. In Thailand, they’re often served on the side for you to garnish with as you like, along with a little bit of sugar, chili, powder, lime, and fish sauce. Mike’s allergic so when we’re eating out, we always have our pad Thai without, but when we’re eating out but at home, we like to add chopped roasted cashews for a little nutty creamy crunch.,Happy pad Thai-ing!"

"I’m forever making meatballs for weeknight dinners and Mike thinks I’m crazy to want to mix up meat, roll them into balls and cook them, but I love meatballs! Really, it doesn’t take a huge amount of time to mix them up at roll them and you don’t use anything chopped up, it goes a lot faster. Instead of chopping onions or mincing garlic, I like to use garlic powder and onion powder in weeknight meatballs just because it’s so much faster. Plus, when you bake your balls, it basically leaves you with some time to relax while the balls are getting all crispy in the oven.,These peri peri meatballs were inspired by Mike’s peri peri chicken, and Bon Appetit’s peri peri meatballs,. I basically did a mashup of the two sauces. Classical peri peri contains special African peri peri chilis, which are essentially the African version of a bird’s eye chili, which is pretty much very close to Thai red chilis. I went with Thai red chilis and a bell pepper (like Mike does for his sauce), but added in the smoked paprika that Bon Appetit suggested for an extra hit of smokiness. All peri peri sauces have vinegar I went with rice vinegar because I love the rich lightness and tang.,Making peri peri is incredibly easy: pop everything into the blender, press the button and you’re done. Some of the peri peri sauce goes into the meatball mix for extra flavor, then from there, it’s just a question of mixing, rolling and baking. You might notice that these meatballs have just egg yolks and no whites and that’s because sometimes when you cook meatballs at a high heat, like we’re doing here, and they have no breadcrumbs, the egg whites tend to leak out. We’re solving that problem by just using yolks.,Also, if you’re not doing keto or low carb or you just like breadcrumbs in your meatballs, go for it! Without breadcrumbs, they are a tiny bit more meaty as opposed to tender, but I’m willing to sacrifice for that keto life.,These guys were amazing: spicy, smoky, meaty, and smothered in piri piri sauce. I loved the bed of sour cream and extra drizzle of olive oil. Definite keeper. At the very least, make the sauce and put it on EVERYTHING."

"Tomorrow is Mike’s birthday and with any luck, he’ll be having a great day, planned out for him by his wonderful wife, me! Really though, I’m kidding because I absolutely suck at planning out birthdays. I get mildly anxious (okay, a lot anxious) when I need to make decisions about things that I think are important. And birthdays are important! I mean, they’re a day to celebrate someone’s existence. And in this case, not just any someone, but ,.,Usually I have it pretty easy because for the past couple of years we’ve been lucky enough to have coincidentally been in Tokyo for Mike’s birthdays. Planning a birthday in Japan is easy. All the food is amazing and even just walking around is fascinating. If you’re into whiskey, like Mike is, there are a plethora of whiskey places or little cocktail bars that are fun and celebratory. Plus, you should always eat noodles on your birthday and as we all know, Tokyo is full of ramen, so that’s easily sorted. Side note, do you guys eat noodles on your birthday? It’s a thing Mike and do – ,.,Anyway, tomorrow there’s definitely going to be some noodle eating, but I also wanted to make Mike a special pre-birthday meal, just because. I thought about it long and hard because it’s actually kind of hard cooking for Mike. He kind of likes everything but doesn’t really , anything. Okay, no, that’s a lie. He loves Chinese bbq pork, fried chicken, steak frites, sushi, and ramen. I made him , a couple of years ago, but this year I wanted to kind of be nostalgic so I made him something that I tried to make him very early on in our relationship.,Our very first trip abroad together was to Europe. It was my first time and it was pretty magical. It was extra fun because Mike had been before and we managed to go to a couple of his favorite places, one of them being Nice, France. We went to this little bistro that served amazing daube (beef stew, if you, like me, have no idea what daube is). It was one of our favorite meals on our trip, partially because Mike talked it up before we got there and partially because it lived up to the hype. It was rich and deep, full of beefiness. They served it with your choice of ravioli, gnocchi, or spaghetti. I chose ravioli, but Mike got gnocchi.,So, being in an super nostalgic mood (birthdays always make me nostalgic) I thought I’d make daube with gnocchi. The thing is, this isn’t the first time I’ve tried – , – to make daube. It was a very long time ago, basically before I even knew how to cook, let alone hold a knife properly. Nonetheless, I went all out and bought some super expensive organic groceries and attempted to make a French stew that I essentially knew nothing about. I had high hopes, but surprise, surprise, it didn’t turn out at all. Mike kindly told me he loved it, but I knew. I mean, I didn’t know how to make daube, but I knew how it was supposed to taste, and it wasn’t anything like what I made.,Sad thing is, years later and I still don’t know how to make daube. Really, I tried, but…well, let’s just say that this time around the stew tasted good, but again, ,. After a lot of post-cooking research and debriefing I know exactly what I did wrong. There’s a key step in making daube and if you skip out on it, you’ve made beef. Beef cooked in wine, but still, beef in wine. Anyway, this key step I missed out on is literally beef.in.wine. You need to marinate the beef, along with a bunch of aromatics, in wine for 24 hours. I don’t know what it does but it does something awesome and makes beef stew not just beef stew, but magical French beef stew.,So this time around, Mike, again, years later told me that my daube tasted good. Inside I was cringing because how did I manage to repeat a failed cooking experiment years apart, but I guess some things never change. Things like how much I love Mike and how I will never stop trying to impress him with my non-existent cooking skills.,Happiest of birthdays to you, boo. You are my most favorite person in the world and I love how we sometimes say the same thing at the exact same time, which either means: we spend too much time together and are disgustingly lovey, or we spend too much time together are and delightfully lovey. Either way, thank you for being you because I couldn’t imagine anyone else I’d rather adventure around the world with. I love you :),PS – Next year, bbq pork, kay? I know how to make that one ;),Birthday posts of years past, if you’re interested: ,, ,, and ,."
"Come summer I’m all about the strawberries. My mom has always had a couple of bushes in her yard and there’s nothing quite like the taste of a perfectly ripe, still warm from the sun strawberry. When I see all the local berries popping up at the farmer’s markets, I know it’s time for some berry goodness. I love them in ,, I love them in ,, and I love them with pancakes!,When I’m having brunch, I can never decide between sweet or savory. With these little mini strawberry shortcake pancakes, you get the best of both worlds. Because they’re mini, you can have just a couple for breakfast/brunch dessert, after you’ve had your main course. Genius, right? Plus, who doesn’t love mini things? Okay, actually, I think a lot of people don’t like mini things and I’ve been seeing a huge amount (pun intended) of giant foods popping up on instagram and youtube lately so maybe mini things are just something I like?,Anyway, mini or not, these strawberry pancakes are the best because they remind me of strawberry shortcakes but way easier and faster to make because you don’t need to turn on the oven to make shortcakes. What’s up with strawberry shortcake by the way? Some people make their shortcakes with biscuit like shortcakes and some people make theirs with actual fluffy cake. I happen to like both so it’s not much of a debate around here, but I hear that it’s hotly contested which strawberry shortcake is the “real” strawberry shortcake.,If I’m having strawberries in a dessert and not on their own, I like to do a little strawberry sweetening with a bit of sugar and a tiny pinch of salt. The sugar macerates the strawberries, breaking them down a tiny bit so they form a glossy ruby red sauce and the salt adds just a hint of contrast making the berries taste all the more sweet. Juicy strawberry sauce is what makes these pancakes so delicious!"
